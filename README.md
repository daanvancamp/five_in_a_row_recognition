# five_in_a_row_recognition
**The recognition is unusable as of right now. That will be fixed in a few weeks.**

Is part of this project: https://github.com/daanvancamp/gomoku-thesis-proj
This is the image recognition part.
Note that  winows specific API is used, so if you would want to use this opn another system, then you will need to change that API to another one. Then you need to change this line     cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1, cv2.CAP_DSHOW) and just delete that API/keyword argument.
Only the programa 'vijf op een rij beeldherkenning' is stable. **I am working to integrate both repositories into each other, but I will first make sure that both programs are stable.**


Note: the project is still under development. Some features aren't stable as of right now. The project will hopefully be finished in april of 2025, so you can expect the stable and complete version ultimately then, but it could be done earlier.
