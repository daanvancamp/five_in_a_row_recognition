# vijf_op_een_rij_beeldherkenning
Is part of this project: https://github.com/daanvancamp/gomoku-thesis-proj
This is the image recognition part.
note that  winows specific API is used, so if you would want to use this opn another system, then you will need to change that API to another one. Then you need to change this line     cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1, cv2.CAP_DSHOW) and just delete that API.
