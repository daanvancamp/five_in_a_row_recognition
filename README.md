# five_in_a_row_recognition

Is part of this project: https://github.com/daanvancamp/gomoku-thesis-proj
This is the image recognition part.
Note that  winows specific API is used, so if you would want to use this on another system, then you will need to change that API to another one. Then you need to change this line     cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1, cv2.CAP_DSHOW) and just delete that API/keyword argument.
 
**I am working to integrate both repositories into each other, but I will first make sure that both programs are stable.**
